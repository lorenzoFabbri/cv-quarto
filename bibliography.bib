  abstract = {Background Individuals are exposed to environmental pollutants with endocrine disrupting activity (endocrine disruptors, EDCs) and the early stages of life are particularly susceptible to these exposures. Previous studies have focused on identifying molecular signatures associated with EDCs, but none have used repeated sampling strategy and integrated multiple omics. We aimed to identify multi-omic signatures associated with childhood exposure to non-persistent EDCs. Methods We used data from the HELIX Child Panel Study, which included 156 children aged 6 to 11. Children were followed for one week, in two time periods. Twenty-two non-persistent EDCs (10 phthalate, 7 phenol, and 5 organophosphate pesticide metabolites) were measured in two weekly pools of 15 urine samples each. Multi-omic profiles (methylome, serum and urinary metabolome, proteome) were measured in blood and in a pool urine samples. We developed visit-specific Gaussian Graphical Models based on pairwise partial correlations. The visit-specific networks were then merged to identify reproducible associations. Independent biological evidence was systematically sought to confirm some of these associations and assess their potential health implications. Results 950 reproducible associations were found among which 23 were direct associations between EDCs and omics. For 9 of them, we were able to find corroborating evidence from previous literature: DEP - serotonin, OXBE - cg27466129, OXBE - dimethylamine, triclosan - leptin, triclosan - serotonin, MBzP - Neu5AC, MEHP - cg20080548, oh-MiNP - kynurenine, oxo-MiNP - 5-oxoproline. We used these associations to explore possible mechanisms between EDCs and health outcomes, and found links to health outcomes for 3 analytes: serotonin and kynurenine in relation to neuro-behavioural development, and leptin in relation to obesity and insulin resistance. Conclusions This multi-omics network analysis at two time points identified biologically relevant molecular signatures related to non-persistent EDC exposure in childhood, suggesting pathways related to neurological and metabolic outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background Evidence suggests that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may perturb the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, which has a major role in brain development. We aimed to evaluate the effects of childhood exposure to organophosphate pesticides, phenols, and phthalate metabolites, on urinary glucocorticosteroids and inattention in childhood. Methods We used data from the Human Early-Life Exposome (HELIX) cohort (2013--2016) and the parametric g-formula to estimate associations between EDCs, glucocorticosteroids, and hit reaction time standard error (HRT-SE), a measure of inattention, and tested for possible effect modification by sex. Results We observed a positive marginal contrast (MC) for exposure increases from the 10th to the 90th percentile for methyl-paraben (MC: 0.042 and 95\% confidence interval (CI): (0.013, 0.071)), and the phthalate metabolites oxo-MiNP (MC: 0.023 and 95\% CI: (0.003, 0.044)), oh-MiNP (MC: 0.039 and 95\% CI: (0.001, 0.076)), and MEHP (MC: 0.036 and 95\% CI: (0.008, 0.063)), on HRT-SE, indicating lower attention. Several EDCs were also associated with a positive MC for cortisone, cortisol, and corticosterone production. Increased levels of the glucocorticosteroids were not associated with HRT-SE, although we found a possible effect modification by sex. Conclusions Our results suggest that multiple EDCs might interfere with inattention and with the homeostasis of the HPA axis.},

  abstract = {Background Exposure to environmental chemicals is suspected to influence attentional function, yet causal evidence is inconsistent. We triangulated multiple lines of evidence to estimate the effects of prenatal and childhood exposure to environmental chemicals on adolescent attention problems. Methods We followed 1,658 participants in the European Human Early-Life Exposome cohort. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), metals, phenols, and phthalate and organophosphate pesticide (OPP) metabolites were measured during pregnancy and childhood. Adolescent attention problems were evaluated with the Child Behavior Checklist. Evidence was triangulated across single-pollutant regression models, negative-control designs, instrumental-variable (IV) regression and Mendelian Randomization (MR). We estimated mixture effects using the parametric g-formula. Results In single exposure models, higher levels of several chemicals were associated with fewer attentional problems (prenatal PFOS, {$\beta$}0{$\rightarrow$}1 and 95~\% confidence interval (CI) for a unit increase from 0 to 1: -0.86 (-1.63, -0.09); prenatal PFHxS: -1.32 (-2.44, -0.21); childhood BUPA: -0.78 (-1.27, -0.29)). Higher levels of prenatal BPA and childhood DEP were instead associated with more attentional problems (0.96 (0.02, 1.89) and 0.56 (-0.05, 1.16), respectively). IV regression supported the association of childhood DEP (2.80 (0.86, 4.70)); MR yielded little evidence for causality. Negative-control analyses suggested little to no residual confounding by socio-economic status. A joint increase from the 10th to the 90th percentile in the components of the prenatal PFAS mixture was associated with fewer attentional problems in females (marginal contrast and 95~\% CI: -0.37 (-0.64, -0.10)). Conclusions Triangulation of multiple causal designs suggests that childhood exposure to the OPP metabolite DEP may impair adolescent attentional function.}

  abstract = {Prenatal exposure to ubiquitous endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may increase the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in children, but few studies have studied chemical mixtures or explored underlying protein and metabolic signatures.To investigate associations of prenatal exposure to EDC mixtures with MetS risk score in children and identify associated proteins and metabolites.This population-based, birth cohort study used data collected between April 1, 2003, and February 26, 2016, from the Human Early Life Exposome cohort based in France, Greece, Lithuania, Norway, Spain, and the UK. Eligible participants included mother-child pairs with measured prenatal EDC exposures and complete data on childhood MetS risk factors, proteins, and metabolites. Data were analyzed between October 2022 and July 2023.Nine metals, 3 organochlorine pesticides, 5 polychlorinated biphenyls, 2 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 5 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), 10 phthalate metabolites, 3 phenols, 4 parabens, and 4 organophosphate pesticide metabolites measured in urine and blood samples collected during pregnancy.At 6 to 11 years of age, a composite MetS risk score was constructed using z scores of waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and insulin levels. Childhood levels of 44 urinary metabolites, 177 serum metabolites, and 35 plasma proteins were quantified using targeted methods. Associations were assessed using bayesian weighted quantile sum regressions applied to mixtures for each chemical group.The study included 1134 mothers (mean [SD] age at birth, 30.7 [4.9] years) and their children (mean [SD] age, 7.8 [1.5] years; 617 male children [54.4\%] and 517 female children [45.6\%]; mean [SD] MetS risk score, -0.1 [2.3]). MetS score increased per 1-quartile increase of the mixture for metals ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.44; 95\% credible interval [CrI], 0.30 to 0.59), organochlorine pesticides ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.22; 95\% CrI, 0.15 to 0.29), PBDEs ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.17; 95\% CrI, 0.06 to 0.27), and PFAS ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.19; 95\% CrI, 0.14 to 0.24). High-molecular weight phthalate mixtures ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.07; 95\% CrI, -0.10 to -0.04) and low-molecular weight phthalate mixtures ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.13; 95\% CrI, -0.18 to -0.08) were associated with a decreased MetS score. Most EDC mixtures were associated with elevated proinflammatory proteins, amino acids, and altered glycerophospholipids, which in turn were associated with increased MetS score.This cohort study suggests that prenatal exposure to EDC mixtures may be associated with adverse metabolic health in children. Given the pervasive nature of EDCs and the increase in MetS, these findings hold substantial public health implications.},

  abstract = {Childhood obesity poses a significant public health challenge, yet the molecular intricacies underlying its pathobiology remain elusive. Leveraging extensive multi-omics profiling (methylome, miRNome, transcriptome, proteins and metabolites) and a rich phenotypic characterization across two parts of Europe within the population-based Human Early Life Exposome project, we unravel the molecular landscape of childhood obesity and associated metabolic dysfunction. Our integrative analysis uncovers three clusters of children defined by specific multi-omics profiles, one of which characterized not only by higher adiposity but also by a high degree of metabolic complications. This high-risk cluster exhibits a complex interplay across many biological pathways, predominantly underscored by inflammation-related cascades. Further, by incorporating comprehensive information from the environmental risk-scape of the critical pregnancy period, we identify pre-pregnancy body mass index and environmental pollutants like perfluorooctanoate and mercury as important determinants of the high-risk cluster. Overall, our work helps to identify potential risk factors for prevention and intervention strategies early in the life course aimed at mitigating obesity and its long-term health consequences.},

  abstract = {Drug-induced toxicity is a significant problem in clinical care. A key problem here is a general understanding of the molecular mechanisms accompanying the transition from desired drug effects to adverse events following administration of either therapeutic or toxic doses, in particular within a patient context. Here, a comparative toxicity analysis was performed for fifteen hepatotoxic drugs by evaluating toxic changes reflecting the transition from therapeutic drug responses to toxic reactions at the cellular level. By use of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling, in vitro toxicity data were first contextualized to quantitatively describe time-resolved drug responses within a patient context. Comparatively studying toxic changes across the considered hepatotoxicants allowed the identification of subsets of drugs sharing similar perturbations on key cellular processes, functional classes of genes, and individual genes. The identified subsets of drugs were next analyzed with regard to drug-related characteristics and their physicochemical properties. Toxic changes were finally evaluated to predict both molecular biomarkers and potential drug-drug interactions. The results may facilitate the early diagnosis of adverse drug events in clinical application.},
