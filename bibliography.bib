  abstract = {Background Individuals are exposed to environmental pollutants with endocrine disrupting activity (endocrine disruptors, EDCs) and the early stages of life are particularly susceptible to these exposures. Previous studies have focused on identifying molecular signatures associated with EDCs, but none have used repeated sampling strategy and integrated multiple omics. We aimed to identify multi-omic signatures associated with childhood exposure to non-persistent EDCs. Methods We used data from the HELIX Child Panel Study, which included 156 children aged 6 to 11. Children were followed for one week, in two time periods. Twenty-two non-persistent EDCs (10 phthalate, 7 phenol, and 5 organophosphate pesticide metabolites) were measured in two weekly pools of 15 urine samples each. Multi-omic profiles (methylome, serum and urinary metabolome, proteome) were measured in blood and in a pool urine samples. We developed visit-specific Gaussian Graphical Models based on pairwise partial correlations. The visit-specific networks were then merged to identify reproducible associations. Independent biological evidence was systematically sought to confirm some of these associations and assess their potential health implications. Results 950 reproducible associations were found among which 23 were direct associations between EDCs and omics. For 9 of them, we were able to find corroborating evidence from previous literature: DEP - serotonin, OXBE - cg27466129, OXBE - dimethylamine, triclosan - leptin, triclosan - serotonin, MBzP - Neu5AC, MEHP - cg20080548, oh-MiNP - kynurenine, oxo-MiNP - 5-oxoproline. We used these associations to explore possible mechanisms between EDCs and health outcomes, and found links to health outcomes for 3 analytes: serotonin and kynurenine in relation to neuro-behavioural development, and leptin in relation to obesity and insulin resistance. Conclusions This multi-omics network analysis at two time points identified biologically relevant molecular signatures related to non-persistent EDC exposure in childhood, suggesting pathways related to neurological and metabolic outcomes.},

  abstract = {Drug-induced toxicity is a significant problem in clinical care. A key problem here is a general understanding of the molecular mechanisms accompanying the transition from desired drug effects to adverse events following administration of either therapeutic or toxic doses, in particular within a patient context. Here, a comparative toxicity analysis was performed for fifteen hepatotoxic drugs by evaluating toxic changes reflecting the transition from therapeutic drug responses to toxic reactions at the cellular level. By use of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling, in vitro toxicity data were first contextualized to quantitatively describe time-resolved drug responses within a patient context. Comparatively studying toxic changes across the considered hepatotoxicants allowed the identification of subsets of drugs sharing similar perturbations on key cellular processes, functional classes of genes, and individual genes. The identified subsets of drugs were next analyzed with regard to drug-related characteristics and their physicochemical properties. Toxic changes were finally evaluated to predict both molecular biomarkers and potential drug-drug interactions. The results may facilitate the early diagnosis of adverse drug events in clinical application.},
